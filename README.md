# OTrainers
A Skyrim SE mod that adds OStim scenes for skill trainers

## Features
* Lightweight OStim addon
* Can be safely installed mid-playthrough
* Works with vanilla, DLC and modded* skill trainers
* Your relationship rank matters
* It does not replace the vanilla training

\* He/she needs to be in at least one of skill trainers faction (JobTrainerSpeechcraftFaction, JobTrainerRestorationFaction etc.)

## Requirements
* Skyrim: Special Edition (1.5.39+)
* [Fuz Ro D-oh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109)
* [OStim](https://github.com/Sairion350/OStim) and all its requirements

## Recommended mods
* [OCum](https://github.com/Sairion350/OCum) and all its requirements
* [ORomance](https://github.com/Sairion350/ORomance) and all its requirements

## Installation
Place the mod after (below) OStim and its other addons (OCum, ORomance etc.) in the file order and plugin order.

## Gameplay
The mod adds "I'd like to learn <skill> from you intimately..." dialogue line to all trainers in the game. It starts a mini-game (challenge) in the OStim scene. You can earn up to 3 skill points per training session:
* The first one for making the trainer orgasm
* The second for doing so before player character orgasmed
* The third is relationship bonus if you're the trainer's friend, ally or lover (relationship rank equals 1 or above)

The skill is advanced after the scene ends. You need to wait 6 hours to start another training session. The cooldown doesn't apply to vanilla training.

## Contributing
It is my first mod with scripts, so I am aware that it may not be perfect. Feel free to make a PR if you want to improve the mod.
